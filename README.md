Planning out the Wordle project

Create a layout with five small squares for 5 letter words
Create six rows of these 5 letter words
Create margin-bottom below this flex layout (should this be flex or grid?)
Have a keyboard below with main letter keys, enter and backspace

CSS Settings -
the box layout will need a preset width and height for each box that does not change on changing window size
the keyboard will also need to stay the same size
